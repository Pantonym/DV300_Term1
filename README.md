## About the Project

<!-- Mockup -->
### Mockup
<img src="spynet/src/Assets/readmeAssets/Login.jpg" alt="Mockup" style="height: 600px"/>

<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
### Project Description
SpyNet is a management website where users can purchase ingredients and craft items using those ingredients. Each user is located by a different warehouse, meaning each warehouse tracks its inventory separately. In addition, administrators can create ingredients to be sold on the marketplace. 
### Technologies Used
* TypeScript
* Angular TS
* PostgreSQL

### Built With
<!-- Typescript -->
#### TypeScript
* Built on JavaScript.
* Uses the TypeScript Type system to ensure consistency among variable types, such as Strings or Numbers.
* Ensures that your variable declarations and assignments remain consistent, which reduces bugs.
* Being built on JavaScript, TypeScript functions in any place JS does, most importantly Node.js.
<p>TypeScript was used to build the front end, as well as the backend.</p>
<img src="spynet/src/Assets/readmeAssets/TS.png" alt="TS_Logo" style="width: 300px; height: auto;" />

<!-- Angular TS -->
#### Angular TS
* It is a TypeScript library.
* It is maintained by Google, and follows single-page routing.
* Used to create the frontend of the website.
<p>Angular TS allowed us to build and test the frontend of the website.</p>
<img src="spynet/src/Assets/readmeAssets/AXIOS.png" alt="AJAX-Logo" style="width: 400px; height: 225px;"/>

<!-- PostgreSQL -->
#### PostgreSQL
* Open Source Object-Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS).
* Uses Structured Query Language (SQL)
* Supports more complex data models than MySQL.
<p>PostgreSQL was used to implement backend functionality to implement CRUD functionality to the website.</p>

<!-- Main Features and Functionality -->
## Features and Functionality
1. Landing Page - Page Navigation
* Pages are connected through routing, specifically the `app.routes.ts` file.
`export const routes: Routes = [`
`    { path: "dashboard", component: DashboardComponent },`
`    { path: "login", component: LoginComponent },`
`    { path: "marketplace", component: MarketplaceComponent, canActivate: [AuthGuard]  },`
`    { path: "marketplace-admin", component: MarketplaceAdminComponent, canActivate: [AdminAuthGuard]  },`
`    { path: "warehouses/:id", component: WarehousesComponent, canActivate: [AuthGuard] },`
`    { path: "", redirectTo: "dashboard", pathMatch: "full" },`
`    { path: "**", component: PagenotfoundComponent }`
`];`

* The routes are also protected using an AuthGuard system:
`return inject(AuthService).checkCurrentUserLoggedIn()`
`  // if it is true, leave it as-is`
`  ? true`
`  // otherwise, redirect to "/login"`
`  : inject(Router).createUrlTree(['/login']);`

* Navigation links are added though `<a>` tags which redirect the website through using `href`. Because a navigation bar is unnecessary, each page is connected through buttons at the top or bottom of the screen, giving the impression of moving from one location to another.

2. Landing Page - Website Information
* The website information is stored in an accordion, which was created using the HTMLDetailsElement, as well as the HTMLSummaryElement as such:
`<details>`
`  <summary>`
`    What is this?`
`  </summary>`
`  <div style="background-color: white; color: black;">`
`    This is an inventory tracking/crafting website for agents in the field to use to make gadgets and tools for their missions.`
`  </div>`
`</details>`

* This was done to not overwhelm the user with too much text - they can click to activate the accordion as they go from one item ot the next.

3. Authentication Page - Log In using unconventional verification methods
* Protect Users using BCrypt:
* When the user registers, the bcrypt password is generated. Using SALT, a random value is added to the end of the encrypted password to further encrypt it. After the SALT is generated, the password is Hashed.
`const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(Number(process.env.SALT));`
`const hashPassword = await bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, salt);`

* When the user logs in, because the password is encrypted, it is tested using `bcrypt.compare()`.
`// check if the passwords match`
`bcrypt.compare(password, userRequest.password, (error, result) => {`
`  // result will be true or false`
`  if (result) { //passwords match`
`    userRequest!.password = "Protected by SpyNet"; //set the password to empty to not expose it. This protects user information. This will not save the password to an empty string as it does not call the .save function.`
`    return res.json(userRequest) //send the user data if login is a success`
`  } else { //passwords do not match`
`    return res.status(500).json({ message: "Invalid Credentials" })`
`  }`
`})`

* To add unconventional verification, the user must solve a puzzle involving Sliders:
`if (sliderLeftValue === 100 && sliderRightValue === 0) {`
`// Validation`
`if (this.login.value.email != "" && this.login.value.password != "") {`
`   ...`
`  }`
`} else {`
`  this.errorMessage = "Competency Test Failed."`
`}`

4. Warehouse Overview Page - Individual Warehouse Information
* Dynamic cards are used to generate the output for each of the warehouses. There are also three buttons, each of which sends a parameter to the URL which changes which set of the cards are displayed, therefore the suer is able to see each warehouse's information. It also saves the active warehouse to SessionStorage for use in other files.
`<button (click)="warehouseChange3()" class="btnWarehouse button-80" role="button"><a routerLink="/warehouses/1" routerLinkActive="active"> Agent Bigears: 003 `
`</a></button>`

`warehouseChange3() {`
`  this.warehouseID = 3;`
`  sessionStorage.setItem("warehouse", "3");`
`}`
* This also shows the requirement of having three warehouses.

5. Warehouse Overview Page - Inventory Summary and Information
* Using a material card and an ngFor loop, the inventory item's image, name, description and total is shown.
`<app-warehouse-card *ngFor="let item of ingredientList" [item]="item"></app-warehouse-card>`

`<mat-card class="card">`
`  <div style="padding: 5px;">`
`    <div class="left">`
`      <img [src]="item.image" width="80" />`
`    </div>`
`    <div class="left">`
`      <mat-card-content style="width: 300px; text-align: left;">`
`      <mat-card-title> Name: {{item.name}} </mat-card-title>`
`      <p> {{item.description}} </p>`
`      <p> Amount: {{item.totalWarehouse1}} </p>`
`      </mat-card-content>`
`    </div>`
`  </div>`
`</mat-card>`

6. Inventory Stock Section - Inventory Displaying
* Using the methods listed above in point 4 and 5, the stock information is shown depending on which warehouse is selected.

7. Inventory Stock Section - Inventory Navigation
* Using the methods listed above in point 4 and 5, the stock changes depending on which warehouse is selected.

8. Inventory Stock Section - Inventory Information
* Displaying the Name, Category, Amount and Image:
`<mat-card class="card">`
`  <div style="padding: 5px;">`
`    <div class="left">`
`      <img [src]="item.image" width="80" />`
`    </div>`
`    <div class="left">`
`      <mat-card-content style="width: 300px; text-align: left;">`
`      <mat-card-title> Name: {{item.name}} </mat-card-title>`
`      <p> {{item.description}} </p>`
`      <p> Amount: {{item.totalWarehouse1}} </p>`
`      </mat-card-content>`
`    </div>`
`  </div>`
`</mat-card>`

9. Inventory Stock Section - Updating Inventory Amount
* The user is able to update the inventory amount through accessing the marketplace and buying an item. Please take note, the relevant ingredient will only increment by 1
only in the selected agents inventory. To change inventories, simply select a different one on the crafting page.
*The admin marketplace allows admin users to add a new item to the ingredients list, take note: this new item is set to 0 across all inventories upon creation, so new stock will
have to be purchased in every warehouse where applicable.
*The price simulates real world stock market behavior by randomizing itself after every purchase, across all items. It also gives some errors in the console, but they have no impact 
on the functionality of the website and can be ignored.
*Admin users are redirected automatically to the admin marketplace, while regular users can only access the regular marketplace due to the authguard system.



10. Craft Section - Crafting Recipes and Updating Inventory Amount
* First, the data is collected:
`<button class="btnCraft" (click)="craftNewRecipe(recipeItem.id!, 1)">Craft</button></p>`

`craftNewRecipe(recipeID: number, warehouseID: number) {`
`  this.service.getSingleRecipe(recipeID).subscribe(async (recipe: Recipe) => {`
`    const ingredientsNeeded: number[] = recipe.ingredientsNeeded.map(id => Number(id)); // Cast each element to number`
`    const ingredientsObject = await this.getIngredients(ingredientsNeeded);`
`...`

* The getIngredients Function forms an array of objects, consisting only of the ingredients needed in the recipe as the recipe table only saves the ingredient's ID. This is done asynchronously to ensure the data is collected before the put request is sent.
`async getIngredients(ingredientsNeeded: number[]) {`
`    const ingredientsObjects: any[] = [];`
`    const fetchPromises: Promise<void>[] = [];`
`    for (let k = 0; k < ingredientsNeeded.length; k++) {`
`      const ingredientID = ingredientsNeeded[k]; // Directly using the ingredientID`
`      fetchPromises.push(`
`      new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => {`
`        this.service.fetchIngredientData(ingredientID).subscribe((ingredientData: any) => {`
`          ingredientsObjects.push({ data: ingredientData });`
`          resolve();`
`        }, error => {`
`          reject(error);`
`        });`
`      })`
`    );`
`  }`
`  // Wait for all ingredient fetch promises to resolve`
`  await Promise.all(fetchPromises);`
`  return ingredientsObjects;`
`}`

* After that, in the CraftRecipe Function, the put request is sent:
`this.service.craftRecipe(recipeID, ingredientsObject, warehouseID).subscribe(`
`  (data) => {`
`    // Handle successful response here`
`      this.recipeItem.isCraftable = true;`
`      window.location.reload();`
`    },`
`  (error) => {`
`...`

* Finally, the data is saved to the database, and the relevant amount is reduced:
`recipeRouter.put("/:id/craft", async (req, res) => {`
`  try {`
`    let id = parseInt(req.params.id);`
`    let { amount, ingredients, warehouse } = req.body;`
`    var recipeRequest = await appDataSource.getRepository(Recipe).findOneBy({ id: id });`
`    if (!recipeRequest) {`
`      return res.status(500).json({ message: "no recipe found" });`
`    } else {`
`      // change which warehouse is affected based on the values sent through the req.body`
`      if (warehouse === 1) {`
`      // update the amount that has been crafted`
`      recipeRequest!.totalWarehouse1 = recipeRequest!.totalWarehouse1 + amount; // updates (already incremented in frontend)`
`    } else if (warehouse === 2) {...}`
`    recipeRequest!.totalAmount = recipeRequest!.totalWarehouse1 + recipeRequest!.totalWarehouse2 + recipeRequest!.totalWarehouse3;`
`    // Loop through the ingredients and deduct the inventory amount`

* The updateInventoryAmount Function increases the total of the recipe that was crafted in the applicable warehouse
`    var canCraft = await updateInventoryAmount(ingredients, warehouse);`
`    if (canCraft) {`
`      // Save our recipe amount and return it`
`      var newRecipeData = await appDataSource.getRepository(Recipe).save(recipeRequest);`
`      return res.json(newRecipeData);`
`      } else {`
`        return res.status(500).json({ error: "uncraftable" });`
`      }`
`    }`
`  } catch (error) {`
`    return res.status(500).json({ message: error });`
`  }`
`})`

11. Craft Section - Crafting Recipes Only With Enough Inventory
* The updateInventoryAmount Function is used to both update the amount inside of the inventory, and test to see if there are enough ingredients to craft the recipe. The following if-else statement was used:
`if (warehouse === 1) {`
`  // update the ingredient amount`
`  if (ingredientItem.totalWarehouse1 <= 0) {`
`    return false;`
`  } else {`
`    ingredientItems.push(ingredientItem);`
`  }`
`} else if (warehouse === 2) {...}`
* The return immediately exits the function and returns a boolean showing the recipe is not craftable.

12. Craft Section - Crafting Recipes Only With a Single Warehouse's Inventory
* The following code is found in the updateInventoryAmount Function, directly after the code ensures ingredient has enough stock:
`// change which warehouse is affected based on the values sent through the req.body`
`if (warehouse === 1) {`
`  // update the ingredient amount`
`  // Each item can only be used once, so there is no need for an amount needed table`
`  ingredientExample!.totalWarehouse1 = ingredientExample!.totalWarehouse1 - 1;`
`} else if (warehouse === 2) {`
`  // Each item can only be used once, so there is no need for an amount needed table`
`  ingredientExample!.totalWarehouse2 = ingredientExample!.totalWarehouse2 - 1;`
`} else if (warehouse === 3) {`
`  // Each item can only be used once, so there is no need for an amount needed table`
`  ingredientExample!.totalWarehouse3 = ingredientExample!.totalWarehouse3 - 1;`
`}`

13. Craft Section - Crafting Recipes Only Adds to the Correct Warehouse's Amount
* The following excerpt from the code shown in point 10 is applicable, as it ensures only the correct warehouse is targeted:
`if (warehouse === 1) {`
`      // update the amount that has been crafted`
`      recipeRequest!.totalWarehouse1 = recipeRequest!.totalWarehouse1 + amount; // updates (already incremented in frontend)`
`    } else if (warehouse === 2) {...}`

14. Craft Section - At Least 5 Craftable Items
* There are 5 Craftable Items, as shown in the Demonstration Video.

<!-- Development PROCESS -->
## Development Process
### Architecture
The application consists of multiple TypeScript pages and Angular components. It communicates with an SQL database to receive and send information. `HTTPRequest` was used to contact the database, which was accessed through `pgAdmin 4` to create the database used in this project, as well as the application `Insomnia` to test the functionality.
### Design Frame
How might we create a solution to the problem of needing an online web application that hosts crafting and storing of information that can be accessed through several warehouses that don't share inventory?
### Solution
The SpyNet application, which can Create, Read and Update entries in an SQL-based Database for users, warehouse, recipe and ingredient data.
### Theme
We chose a theme that highlighted the 'international spy' idea, having multiple different agents who access warehouses to craft tools out of seemingly useless objects. The website imitates the types of websites you would see in spy movies, but adds a unique spin on the common trope of creating tools out of random objects.

<!-- Highlights -->
#### Highlights
* A great highlight was the team working together to create a functioning application. 
* Finding solutions to the problems we faced was very rewarding, such as how to form an ingredients array to send to the crafting functionality.
* It was very rewarding to see the project's UI change from the simplistic original design to a much more refined and complex design, making the project much more aesthetically pleasing.
* When the crafting section finally started working and came to life, the project felt like it was finally coming together.
* The CSS for each page was very fun to do

<!-- Challenges -->
<!-- Explain the challenges faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved), or how you solved it -->
#### Challenges
* One of the biggest challenges faced was how to force the code to wait for the ingredient data before submitting the crafting request. This was solved through a Promise Async/Await loop.
* Changes being reverted through versions was a slight problem, however the team worked together to ensure this happened as little as possible.
* Learning angular SQL calls was a bit challenging
* Postgres' load times.
* The sliders on the login page are made out of minecraft bedrock, they cannot be changed in any way.

<!-- Future Implementation -->
### Future Implementation
* Change the crafting functionality to not use the recipe and ingredients tables, but to use a JoinTable function to create a combination of the two to allow for immediate access to information without the need for promises. 
* Implement the ability for users to craft unique recipes that they make themselves. 
* We would also like to make the website completely responsive.
